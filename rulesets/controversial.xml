<ruleset name="Controversial Rules">
  <description>
The Controversial Ruleset contains rules that, for whatever reason, are considered controversial.  They
are separated out here to allow people to include as they see fit via custom rulesets.  This ruleset was
initially created in response to discussions over UnnecessaryConstructorRule which Tom likes but
most people really dislike :-)

    <rule name="UnnecessaryConstructorRule"
          message="Avoid unnecessary constructors - the compiler will generate these for you"
          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.XPathRule">
      <description>
  Unnecessary constructor detects when a constructor is not necessary; i.e., when there's only one constructor,
  it's public, has an empty body, and takes no arguments.

          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.NullAssignmentRule">
      <description>
 Assigning a "null" to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually in
 bad form.  Some times, the assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn't
 completely understand what is going on in the code.  NOTE: This sort of assignment
 may in rare cases be useful to encourage garbage collection.  If that's what you're using
 it for, by all means, disregard this rule :-)

     <description>
     Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and
     methods are public abstract.
     Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public
     and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static).
     For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context
     are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.

    <rule name="SuspiciousOctalEscapeRule"
       message="Suspicious decimal characters following octal escape in string literal"
          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.SuspiciousOctalEscapeRule">
      <description>
      A suspicious octal escape sequence was found inside a String literal.
      The Java language specification (section 3.10.6) says an octal
      escape sequence inside a literal String shall consist of a backslash
      followed by:

           OctalDigit | OctalDigit OctalDigit | ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit

      Any octal escape sequence followed by non-octal digits can be confusing,
      e.g. "\038" is interpreted as the octal escape sequence "\03" followed by
      the literal character "8".
