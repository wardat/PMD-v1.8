<p>
PMD checks source code against rules and produces a report.  Like this:
<ul>
<li>Something passes a file name and a RuleSet into PMD</li>
<li>PMD hands an InputStream to the file off to a JavaCC-generated parser</li>
<li>PMD gets a reference to an Abstract Syntax Tree back from the parser</li>
<li>Each Rule in the RuleSet gets to traverse the AST and check for problems</li>
<li>The Report is now filled with RuleViolations, and those get printed out in XML or HTML or whatever</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A paucity of detail, I'm sure you'd agree.  If you think this document can be
improved, please post <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=188192">here</a> and let me know how.  Thanks!
